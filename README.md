## This Project

Websites nowadays are usually built using preexisting forms or templates and frameworks like wordpress. But this business website is built in a different manner, using a [full-stack framework, nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) and email sender services.

It is designed both for mobile and web experience using [tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a fully customisable design.

Using [sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/) email services, data submited via the communication page of this website is sent to the selected email address.

This project can also serve as a template for any case that a personal website is needed.
